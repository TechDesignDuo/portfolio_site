						HTML, while also commissioned by small, local businesses for private projects. I am excited to share with you more about myself, my work, my interests and my projects.</p>

					<h2 class="major">The Pandemic</h2>
					<p>Ever heard of COVID? Yeah, I know you have. The most rocky part of my entire life. As restaurant workers, my life partner and I were both laid off on March 17th, 2020 (and believe me, I didn't need to double-check that date). But I was
						lucky. The tough-loving kitchen life prepared me for this challenge physically, and my partner helped me mentally. This date marks the beginning of an "idea" to learn new skills while waiting to go back to work.</p>

					<h2 class="major">TechDesignDuo</h2>
					<p>From the ashes of my last three years, rose a new idea: what if I took my favourite parts of my cooking career - strategizing, designing, and creating - and applied it to something else? The world of tech is loaded with all sorts of
						possibilities. I wasn't sure which path to take, so I took some advice and "tried out" Python... Coolest thing ever. From there, it's been a journey of trying, failing and learning. My partner helped me create the TechDesignDuo logo (she
						completes the Duo in my adventure) and so here we are today.</p>

					<p>The biggest lesson that I learned in my culinary career is to respect the hard work of small, family-owned businesses. At my last restaurant, we sourced 99% of our products from local farmers, located within 100km from our position.
						Naturally, I was excited to try my hand at doing web development and design work with local businesses when the opportunity arose.</p>

						The only original items are now the logo and the domain name. But we didn't stop there. Since then, we also applied months of work to improve their online presence. Thanks to our team effort, their website is now helping them generate a
